Q4
Top ten athletes win the most medals
  
WITH TEMP AS (SELECT aid, COUNT(medal) AS total_medals
  FROM PERFORMANCEOFATHLETES
  GROUP BY aid
  ORDER BY total_medals DESC)
  SELECT A.name, T.total_medals
  FROM TEMP T, Athletes A
  WHERE T.aid = A.aid AND ROWNUM <=10


By clicking the name of each athlete, show athlete profile
SELECT A.name, A.DOB, A.gender, C.name as Country
FROM Athletes A, Represents R, Country C
WHERE A.aid = R.aid AND C.code = R.code AND A.name = var

We can also have top N athletes

GROUP BY C.name
ORDER BY total DESC


By clicking the name of each country (var = ccode), show economics
SELECT *
